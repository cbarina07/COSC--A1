  <p> The Entertainer:

An Entertainer (ESFP) is a person with the Extraverted, Observant, Feeling, and Prospecting personality traits. These people love vibrant experiences, engaging in life eagerly and taking pleasure in discovering the unknown. They can be very social, often encouraging others into shared activities. </p>

<p>I personally think everything about this description matches me brilliantly. Furthermore, the entertainers' other traits of passion, spontaneity, excitedness and empathy are all traits that I value highly in myself. I am always starting new projects or new topics I'm passionate about and I definitely want others to feel my level of passion for things in my life or theirs.</p>

<p>The less flattering attributes of "the entertainer‚Äù such as conflict avoiding behaviour and the intense need to be constantly mentally sated is also incredibly true to myself. I am definitely a self-diagnosed shopaholic and if I'm not currently working on something, buying something, or changing something I often feel restless and sometimes a little hopeless.</p>

<p>In groups or teams, I always find myself in a facilitator role. I am well organized and thus usually very good at organising tasks and people. I am generally able to make a space that everyone feels comfortable and valued in, and love hearing multiple view points and ideas. Because of this, I am not so much worried about who I work with when forming a team. As far as I am concerned, the more diversity of a group, the stronger the project. The only time in which I can imagine a team with me in it not working is when there is a lack of drive or passion. I get overly excited about the projects I am working on and will feel discouraged when others do not mirror that.   </p>
