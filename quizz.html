  <p> The Entertainer:

An Entertainer (ESFP) is a person with the Extraverted, Observant, Feeling, and Prospecting personality traits. These people love vibrant experiences, engaging in life eagerly and taking pleasure in discovering the unknown. They can be very social, often encouraging others into shared activities. </p>

<p>I personally think everything about this description matches me brilliantly. Furthermore, the entertainers' other traits of passion, spontaneity, excitedness and empathy are all traits that I value highly in myself. I am always starting new projects or new topics I'm passionate about and I definitely want others to feel my level of passion for things in my life or theirs.</p>

<p>The less flattering attributes of "the entertainer” such as conflict avoiding behaviour and the intense need to be constantly mentally sated is also incredibly true to myself. I am definitely a self-diagnosed shopaholic and if I'm not currently working on something, buying something, or changing something I often feel restless and sometimes a little hopeless.</p>

<p>In groups or teams, I always find myself in a facilitator role. I am well organized and thus usually very good at organising tasks and people. I am generally able to make a space that everyone feels comfortable and valued in, and love hearing multiple view points and ideas. Because of this, I am not so much worried about who I work with when forming a team. As far as I am concerned, the more diversity of a group, the stronger the project. The only time in which I can imagine a team with me in it not working is when there is a lack of drive or passion. I get overly excited about the projects I am working on and will feel discouraged when others do not mirror that.   </p>

<h3>How I Study</h3>
<p>The next test I did was a test to identify how you learn best. Unsurprisingly the scores I got in order from greatest to least was Kinaesthetic (14) Aural (8) Visual (6) and Read/ Write (4).  I have always done way better by doing rather than by reading how to do it or having someone tell me. Whether its in mathematics, sports, or even learning HTML, I need to be able to actually do it myself in order for it to truly solidify in my brain. That means that physically typing something out, putting something together, or creating a diagram is the best way for me to be able to visualise and learn. </p>
<p>This would mean that when working in a team, I would need to make idea flow charts, brainstorming papers, or anything tactile that will help me organize and delegate. It also means that I would most likely want to partake in rolls that actually had me physically make something whether it’s the actual products itself or a section of code. </p>
<p>I also understand that if I'm not actually doing it myself I will probably feel detached and checked out and more likely not to notice mistakes as it won't feel personal to me. Therefore, I know I need to be able to take a step back and allow others around me to be more hands on but be aware this it might impact my relationship to the project.</p>
