  <h3>About Me</h2>

  <p>When I was 5 years old, my sister and I were watching a movie on the couch in our home in Melbourne. In the kitchen my mother and father were debating on where we were going to go for our family vacation. After seeing my sister and I watching Lilo and Stitch, my mum decided that Hawaii would be the perfect place to visit. Within just a year of our first visit, we had moved from our home in Australia to Oahu, Hawaii where I lived for just over 12 years. After high school I moved back to Melbourne and began studying at the Conservatorium of Music. I loved playing bassoon and had participated in multiple youth symphonies over the years. However, after a couple of months I decided it was not for me, I didn’t feel the same passion studying as I did actually playing. I left my degree to work and held 3 hospitality jobs, but when COVID hit, I lost all of them. After a couple months of unemployment, I started working at a call centre where after just 4 months, was invited to apply for a new position in the technical support team. During the interview, I thought I had blown it when they asked me “what will you bring to the team” and I couldn’t think of anything tactile, or knowledge based that I was bringing so my gut answer was “passion and joy?.” I did in fact make it into the team and my joy and passion has done nothing but grow since then. </p>
  <br>
  <p>I got really into gaming around a year after I moved back to Australia. Since I was never really encouraged to play games when I lived at home, my first game I ever played consistently was Apex Legends, and from there I was hooked. During COVID I spent a lot of time working from home in tech support, and the rest of the time was spent gaming. I spent around 20 hours a day in my bedroom during lockdown and because of this I got really into upgrading my office/bedroom/social hangout area into something more welcoming. This is where my love for lighting, automation and creative technology began. </p>
  <br>
  <p>After working in Tech Support for the last two years, I came to the realisation that this was something I was extremely interested in pursuing a career in, rather than another temporary job. Therefore, this year I decided that studying at RMIT was the next logical step. I chose RMIT because my dad went here, and I had also heard that the IT courses were great, but to be honest, I had no idea where the best place for me would be. I tossed up between the Computer Science and Information Technology, and ultimately opted for the IT course, since it appeared to be a broader course which I figured would help with my complete lack of idea of what I wanted to do later on in life.</p>
  <br>
  <p> During my time at RMIT I am hoping to develop enough knowledge and skills to be able to enter a career path that challenges me, allows me to continue to grow, and still allows me to maintain that joy and passion I feel currently. I hope to be able to meet people, make new friends and experience all the bits of university life I never have before. </p>
