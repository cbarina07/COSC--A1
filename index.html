  <p>When I was 5 years old, my sister and I were watching a movie on the couch in our home in Melbourne. In the kitchen my mother and father were discussing vacation plans and after seeing my sister and I watching Lilo and Stitch, my mother decided that Hawaii would be the perfect place to visit. In under a year, we had moved from our home in Australia to Hawaii where I lived for 12 years. After high school I moved back to Melbourne, where I studied at the Melbourne Conservatorium of Music playing bassoon. I decided it wasn't for me and left early to work. I held 3 hospitality jobs and when covid hit lost all of them. I then started working at a call centre where I almost immediately was accepted into the technical support team. Which ultimately sparked my love for this kind of work.</p>
  <br>
  <p>I got really into gaming around a year after I moved back to Australia. Since I was never really allowed to play games when I lived at home, my first game I ever played consistently was Apex. From there I was hooked. During covid I spent a lot of time working from home in my new job doing technical support, and the rest of the time I was gaming. Thus, I spent around 20 hours a day in my room. Because of this I got really into adding to my computer setup and room which is where my love for lighting and automation started.</p>
  <br>
  <p>After working in Tech support for the last two years, I discovered this was something I was extremely interested in. I wanted to do more than just tech support for a call centre however, therefore studying at RMIT was the next step. I chose RMIT because my dad went here, and I had also heard that the IT courses were brilliant. I tossed up between the Computer Science and Information Technology course and ultimately opted for the IT course since it appeared to be a broader subject which would help with my complete lack of idea of what I want to do as a career.</p>
