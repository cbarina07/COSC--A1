  <p>When I was 5 years old, my sister and I were watching a movie on the couch in our home in Melbourne. In the kitchen my mother and father were discussing vacation plans and after seeing my sister and I watching Lilo and Stitch, my mother decided that Hawaii would be the perfect place to visit. In under a year, (partly due to the fact that my eczema, asthma, and allergies were finally OK for once) we had moved from our home in Australia to Hawaii where I lived for 12 years. After high school I moved back to Melbourne, where I studied at the Melbourne Conservatorium of Music playing Bassoon. I had participated in multiple youth symphonies before that, so I surprised myself when I decided that studying music was not for me. I left my degree to work and held 3 hospitality jobs. When COVID hit, I lost all of them. I then started working at a call centre where after just 4 months, was invited to apply to become the new Remote Interview Support Team member due to the fact that I had always helped my colleagues out with any technical issues they had where I could. I was interviewed for the roll and thought I had blown it when the question “what will you bring to the team” came up and my gut answer was “Joy and passion”, I ended up joining the team. However. I feel like that statement has reigned true because since then my joy and passion for Information Technology has done nothing but grow.</p>
  <br>
  <p>I got really into gaming around a year after I moved back to Australia (about a year before I got into Tech Support). Since I was never really encouraged to play games when I lived at home, my first game I ever played consistently was Apex. From there I was hooked. During COVID I spent a lot of time working from home doing tech support, and the rest of the time, gaming. Thus, I spent around 20 hours a day in my bedroom during lockdown. Because of this I got really into creating a space for myself which is where my love for lighting, automation and creative technology began.</p>
  <br>
  <p>After working in Tech support for the last two years, I discovered this was something I was extremely interested in, and I wanted to do more than just tech support for a call centre. Therefore, this year I decided that studying at RMIT was the next step. I chose RMIT because my dad went here, and I had also heard that the IT courses were brilliant, but to be honest, had no idea where the best place for me would be. I tossed up between the Computer Science and Information Technology, and ultimately opted for the IT course since it appeared to be a broader subject which would help with my complete lack of idea of what I wanted to do later on in life. </p>
