  <h3>What is a Criminal Intelligence Analyst?</h2>

    style="float:left;/* text-align; left;*/">
  <p>As someone who is obsessed with true crime, being able to follow my passion for technology and work alongside law enforcement to bring criminals to justice honestly sounds perfect. Looking into this there are many pathways you can go down to achieve this, however I believe the closest pathway to my interests is as a Criminal Intelligence Officer for a local police force, law enforcement agency, or within the FBI.</p>
  <p>A Criminal Intelligence Analyst assists police or law enforcement by analysing technical data to aid an investigation.</p>
  <p>The skills required for a role like this include would include excellent research and database navigation, ability to work well within a team with great interpersonal skills, ability to work well under pressure, technical knowledge of computer systems, a preference of knowledge in justice or law enforcement and knowledge in cybersecurity and analytics. Many job listings also require at least a bachelor's degree in a relevant field such as Cybersecurity, knowledge in most Microsoft systems, database navigation and the ability to evaluate reports and interpret information from classified and open databases.  </p>
  <p>Data analysis is something I have always found super interesting; drawing relationships and being able to find clues and patterns have always been one thing I have enjoyed from previous research projects. Most of the skills listed for such a job are skills that I will be acquiring throughout my Information Technology Bachelors. Anything further required such as criminology or law enforcement knowledge are areas that I already find fascinating and would have no issues taking such a class as an elective.</p>
